# Average Share Price Calculator

The motive to implement this app is to get a rough idea of the new reflected price of stock before making an investment.



###### Let's understand with the below given example;

*Let's assume you're already purchased Reliance's stock about a month ago. Below given is your investment details:*

**Total Capital Invested:** *₹ 42255*

**Total Number of Shares:** *27*

**Purchasing rate of shares (average price):** *₹ 1565*

Now assume, the current price of Reliance's stock is *₹ 1285*. And to reduce your average stock price you planned to buy *82* more shares, so at this point your average price will be *₹ 1354.36*.



###### Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Enter **price** and **quantity** of shares you're already holding in your demat account.
2. **Add new row** and enter the **current price** of the stock and **quantity** of stock you want to buy.

*After following these steps the app will calculate the **total investment amount**, **total number of shares** and the **final average price** of the stock*.
